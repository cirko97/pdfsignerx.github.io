    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>PDF Signer X is a Chrome extension that allows users to digitally sign PDF documents using certificates
            stored on their local computer or token. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring
            transparency about how your data is handled.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>PDF Signer X does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information. All operations,
            including certificate access and PDF signing, are performed locally on your device using native messaging.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Use of Native Messaging</h2>
        <p>The extension uses Chrome's native messaging API to communicate with a locally installed application. This
            communication is solely used to access certificates and perform digital signatures. No data is sent to
            external servers.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share any user data with third parties. Since no personal data is collected, there is nothing to
            share or sell.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>All operations are performed securely on your local machine. The extension does not have access to your
            certificate store beyond what is required for signing PDFs.</p>
    </section>
